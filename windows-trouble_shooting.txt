#1: Can not start vagrant for the first time
Setup:
Windows 10, 64-bit
VM Provider: VirtualBox 5.1.30

Problem:
When trying to start the vagrant VM for the very first time, the process will stop after a while, stating that some IP addresses for ubuntu packages were not found.

Solution:
- Try starting the virtual machine via the VirtualBox GUI (start VirtualBox GUI as administrator).
- When you need to enter the machines username and password look for it in your local Vagrant directory for the VMs configuration (example: C:\Users\YOUR NAME\.vagrant.d\boxes) and find the Vagrant-file. There, you will find the username and password of your machine.
- Execute 'sudo apt-get update' manually in the VirtualBox GUI.
- Exit the VirtualBox UI and shutdown the vm entirely. Afterwards start vagrant via 'vagrant up' again.
